This application is a basic calculator. 

Requirements:
- numbers with decimals (not just integers)
- addition (1 + 2 is 3)
- subtraction (12 - 4 is 8)
- multiplication (33 * 2 is 66)
- division (3 / 8 is 0.375)
- exponents (2 ^ 3 is 8)
- error messages when you do something wrong

Optional Requirements:
- modulus (10 % 3 is 1)
- trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
- square roots
- negation (- (-3) is just 3)
- angles in degrees or radians depending on current state
- previous result used as first operand
- the ability to store and recall results
- rounding
- logarithms
- arbitrary roots
- conversion from base 10 to binary (for integers only (maybe do decimals too))
